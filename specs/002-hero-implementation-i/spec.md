## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to immediately see an attractive, professional hero section when I land on the main page, so that I understand what NClinic offers and feel confident in their services.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the main page for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** the hero component appears as the first visible element with the clinic name "NClinic" prominently displayed

2. **Given** a user is viewing the hero section, **When** the page finishes loading, **Then** they see the slogan "Na≈°√≠m c√≠lem je v√°≈° zdrav√Ω a kr√°sn√Ω √∫smƒõv bez bolesti" displayed in Czech

3. **Given** a user views the page on a desktop/PC, **When** the hero section renders, **Then** the content width is constrained to 80% of the viewport width and centered

4. **Given** a user views the hero section, **When** animations are enabled in their browser, **Then** the content animates in smoothly with modern visual effects

5. **Given** a user with animations disabled or reduced motion preferences, **When** the page loads, **Then** the hero section displays immediately without animations

6. **Given** a user views the page on a mobile device (<640px), **When** the hero renders, **Then** the content uses 100% width

7. **Given** a user views the page on a tablet (640-1024px), **When** the hero renders, **Then** the content uses 90% width

8. **Given** a user views the page on a desktop (>1024px), **When** the hero renders, **Then** the content uses 80% width

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user has very large font sizes set in browser accessibility settings? [Hero should remain readable and not overflow]
- How does the hero section behave on very wide monitors (3440px+)? [Content should still be constrained to 80% of a reasonable max-width]
- What if the user has a very narrow viewport (320px mobile)? [Content uses 100% width with appropriate padding for readability]
- How does the hero section print? [Should be simplified for print media]

## Notes

**Content Source**: The slogan "Na≈°√≠m c√≠lem je v√°≈° zdrav√Ω a kr√°sn√Ω √∫smƒõv bez bolesti" was extracted from the clinic website using the data extraction script (see `data/extracted-content.md`).

**Design Context**: This is the first visual component users will see, so it sets the tone for the entire website. The modern, clean aesthetic should reflect the clinic's professional yet approachable nature.

**Future Considerations**: This spec establishes the 80% width pattern for all main content sections. Subsequent features should maintain this consistency.
