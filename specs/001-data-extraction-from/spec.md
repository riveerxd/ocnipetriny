## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: How should images from the website be handled? ‚Üí A: Do not download images; focus on extracting structured data (opening hours, doctors, company info including phone, email, ICO, location)
- Q: Should the markdown file include metadata (extraction date, source URL)? ‚Üí A: Include minimal metadata (date only)
- Q: How should network errors be handled during extraction? ‚Üí A: Retry up to 3 times with delay, then report error
- Q: Where should the output markdown file be saved and what should it be named? ‚Üí A: In a `data/` directory as `extracted-content.md`
- Q: What structure should the markdown content follow for the extracted data? ‚Üí A: Structured data format with clear labels (e.g., "Phone:", "Email:", "Hours:")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the NClinic.cz remake, I need to extract all content from the current website (www.nclinic.cz) and save it into a structured markdown file, so that I can reference it when building the new modern single-page application and ensure no content is lost during migration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current nclinic.cz website is accessible, **When** the extraction process runs, **Then** all text content from all sections (Home, Services, Pricing, Contact) is captured in `data/extracted-content.md`

2. **Given** the website contains contact information (phone, email, address, hours), **When** extraction completes, **Then** all contact details are accurately preserved in the markdown file with structured labels (Phone:, Email:, Address:, Hours:, ICO:)

3. **Given** the website lists multiple services with descriptions, **When** extraction completes, **Then** each service and its description is captured with clear section headings

4. **Given** the extraction is complete, **When** reviewing `data/extracted-content.md`, **Then** content is organized logically by section matching the website's navigation structure with extraction date in metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the website is temporarily unavailable? System will retry up to 3 times with delay, then report error if all attempts fail.
- What happens if pricing information is in a non-standard format? System should extract it as-is and preserve the original formatting.
- How are special characters or Czech language diacritics preserved? System must maintain UTF-8 encoding throughout.
- What happens if doctor information is missing or incomplete? System should extract whatever information is available.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
